# JavaScript Concurrency Notes

### Some notes on concurrency in JavaScript

The purpose of this repository is to host my notes and examples problems on the subject of concurrency in JavaScript.

I'm using several different resources, but the most important of them, by far, is Execute Program's course on JavaScript Concurrency. Other resources include a collection of YouTube videos, articles, and entries from Mozilla Developer Network.

I've attempted to arrange my notes in roughly the same order that Execute Program presents the material. The files are numbered f000-fxxx, but I've also given the files names that reflect their topic.
